# Review the mail interface

Review the rendered product independently of the implementation author. Read the requested design and the relevant routes first; use code to explain findings, not as a substitute for observing the interface.

## Coverage

- Public mailbox: create or enter address, receive/list mail, open full content, copy code, preview/download attachment, use saved mail offline, switch address, and manually clear local history.
- Signed-in mail: navigate accounts/folders, compose, read, reply/forward, manage attachments, and access settings within the user's permissions.
- Administration: inspect dense tables, filters, forms, confirmation, error recovery, and restricted actions when those screens changed.
- Shared shell: sign-in, navigation, theme, language selector, install action, notifications, and dialogs.

## Matrix

Use representative 320/375 px phones, a 768 px tablet, and a 1440 px desktop. Check both themes where supported. Check Simplified Chinese, English, a long-label language such as German or Russian, and Arabic right-to-left; sample other supported languages when changed strings or typography warrant it. Include empty, loading, network error, stale/local, long subject/address, and multiple-attachment states.

## Observe

- Can a person identify and finish the primary task without guessing? Are error and offline states distinct from an empty inbox?
- Is every action reachable by keyboard, named for assistive technology, and visibly focused? Do dialogs receive focus, retain it, close with Escape where appropriate, and return it to the opener?
- Do text, controls, status indicators, and disabled states remain understandable at the tested sizes and themes? Is there horizontal overflow or clipped translated copy?
- Does the UI accurately describe address-only public access and device-local saved mail? Do attachment and clear actions behave as labeled?
- Are console errors, broken assets, and regressions absent in the changed paths?

## Report

For each finding, give severity, route/state/viewport/locale, reproduction steps, observed versus expected behavior, and a screenshot or code location when available. Separate verified behavior from assumptions. End with a short release recommendation and any untested risk. Do not create a new visual direction during acceptance review.
